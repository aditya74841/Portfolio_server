Hi, I’m Aditya Ranjan—a MERN stack developer with a growing expertise in AI integration and a deep passion for crafting meaningful digital experiences.

---

### Who I Am

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in the MERN stack:

* **MongoDB** for flexible, scalable data storage
* **Express.js** for efficient backend APIs
* **React.js** for building dynamic, responsive user interfaces
* **Node.js** for server-side logic

What started as a curiosity for how things work has become a consistent drive to build, iterate, and innovate through code.

---

### What I Do

I develop web applications that are functional, responsive, and user-centered. My projects span both frontend and backend, allowing me to create seamless, full-stack solutions. I prioritize:

* Clean architecture
* Scalable backend services
* Interactive and performant UI components
* Continuous learning and optimization

---

### Projects That Define Me

**1. To-Do App**
A productivity-focused task manager supporting CRUD operations, date-based task sorting, and mobile responsiveness.

**2. Personal Portfolio Website**
A React-based portfolio hosted on Netlify showcasing my work, projects, and development journey. It reflects both my technical skills and design sensibilities.

**3. AI Assistant (WIP)**
I am currently developing a custom AI assistant integrated into my portfolio. It will:

* Answer questions about my background and projects
* Act as a dynamic tour guide
* Retain conversation memory
* Evolve as I grow professionally

Built using **OpenAI**, **LangChain**, and **ChromaDB**, this assistant will be an interactive layer on top of my portfolio.

### Why AI?

Artificial Intelligence is not just a trend—it’s the future of problem-solving and personal productivity. I’m learning the underlying concepts behind AI, including:

* Machine Learning fundamentals
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Prompt engineering and LLMs
* Vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation

Tools I’m working with include Hugging Face, OpenAI APIs, Transformers, and LangChain.

My goal is to build tools that not only use AI but explain it and extend it.

---

### Technical Setup

I work on Linux (Pop!\_OS) and my development stack includes:

* VS Code with Tiling Window Manager
* Node.js, Python, Git, Docker
* Postman, MongoDB Compass
* Chrome DevTools, Neovim (learning phase)
* Tmux, Bash/zsh

Even with modest hardware (8GB RAM), I’ve optimized my workflow for speed, simplicity, and control.

---

### Open Source & Community

I believe in contributing to and learning from the open-source community. I’m active in:

* Writing clean README files
* Contributing PRs
* Participating in issue discussions

Open source is where I learn and give back—and I aim to contribute to impactful AI repositories over time.

---

### What Drives Me

My core values:

* **Lifelong learning**: every day is an opportunity to learn something new.
* **Deep work**: I value focused, undistracted hours over scattered multitasking.
* **Learning in public**: I share my journey, challenges, and lessons to grow and connect.

---

### Goals for 2025

* Launch and deploy my personal AI assistant
* Strengthen AI system design knowledge
* Contribute to open-source AI projects
* Network with MERN and AI developers
* Build a personal brand (without showing my face)
* Explore TinyML and edge AI
* Learn Rust or Go for AI tooling
* Start publishing articles and blogs

---

### Final Thoughts

I don’t just want my portfolio to display my work—I want it to reflect how I work and think.
That’s why I’m building an interactive assistant: to transform a static portfolio into a living, evolving demonstration of skill, learning, and ambition.

If you’re a recruiter, developer, or enthusiast interested in collaboration, feedback, or conversation—let’s connect.

I'm Aditya Ranjan, and I'm building the future—one meaningful project at a time.
